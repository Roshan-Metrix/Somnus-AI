# Somnus AI

Somnus AI is a AI-powered companion built with Flutter designed to resolve the root cause of late-night wakefulness: a racing mind. Unlike traditional sleep apps that only offer passive sounds, the Butler engages in a structured, therapeutic dialogue to organize your thoughts, provide cognitive reframing, and guide you into a restful state.

By combining Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-I) principles, Gemini Intelligence, and Long-term Vector Memory, we create a personalized sanctuary that learns your patterns and helps you "park" your worries so you can finally rest.

##  Deployment

The project is deployed via **Serverpod Cloud**, which handles infrastructure orchestration, database management, and scaling.

### Serverpod Cloud Deployment

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install the `scloud` CLI tool (bundled with Serverpod).
   - Ensure you are logged in: `scloud login`.

2. **Configure Secrets:**
   Set your sensitive API keys (like Gemini) using the cloud secret manager:
   ```bash
   scloud secret set GEMINI_API_KEY YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY
   ```

3. **Deploy the Project:**
   Run the deployment command from the root of the Git repository:
   ```powershell
   scloud deploy --project-dir ./backend
   ```
   *This will automatically:*
   - Generate necessary Serverpod code.
   - Build the Flutter web application.
   - Package the server and upload it to Serverpod Cloud.
   - Run database migrations if necessary.

4. **Verify Deployment:**
   Check the status of your live environment:
   ```bash
   scloud deployment show
   ```

5. **Connect the Client:**
   After a successful deployment, you will receive your project's unique URLs.
   - **How to find your URLs**: Run `scloud project list` or check your project settings at [console.serverpod.cloud](https://console.serverpod.cloud).
   - **Update configuration**:
     1. Open `flutter/assets/config.json` and update the `apiUrl` with your new Cloud API URL.
     2. (Optional) Open `flutter/lib/utils/server_url.dart` if you wish to update the hardcoded fallback URL, though this is not required if `config.json` is present.

6. **Web Application Access**:
   Your Flutter web app is automatically hosted and accessible via the provided web URL (e.g., `https://your-project-id.serverpod.space/`).
